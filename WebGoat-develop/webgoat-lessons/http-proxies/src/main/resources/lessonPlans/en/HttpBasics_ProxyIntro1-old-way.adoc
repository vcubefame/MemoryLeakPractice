== Setting up other HTTP Proxy Tools

=== Configure the proxy tool

Configure the proxy tool to listen on a free port on your localhost.

=== Configure the browser

*It is important to note that the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome no longer proxy traffic from localhost by default.*
The are a couple of options to bypass this restriction:

- Use the host name of your machine instead of `localhost`, you can find or add a host name in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOSX and `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` on Windows
- To proxy localhost (and related addresses) with newer Firefox versions (>= 67) the preference network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost (accessible through the about:config page) must be set to true.
- To proxy localhost (and related addresses) with newer Chrome versions (>= 72) the command line argument --proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback> must be provided.

*Remember*: If running WebGoat locally, you can use ZAP's default port of 8080 instead of 8090 (or whatever number you prefer to use)

=== Other Proxy Configuration Options

If you don't want to manage the proxy manually, there are extensions or plugins that can help you to do so without digging through as much config,
or based on URL patterns. Examples include:

* FoxyProxy for Firefox
* Proxy Switcher for Firefox
* Toggle Proxy for Firefox
* Still looking for suggestions for Chrome ..
