=== Exclude WebGoat internal requests (ZAP >= 2.8.0)

Before we start diving into intercepting requests with ZAP we need to exclude the internal requests from the WebGoat
framework otherwise ZAP will also stop at all the requests which are only necessary for the internal working of WebGoat.

In the main ZAP window click on Filter, see image below

Then in the `URL Inc Regex` box type:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/.*
----

And in the `URL Exc Regex` box type:

[source]
----
.*/WebGoat/service/.*mvc
----

Click 'Apply to close the window, ZAP will now no longer show internal WebGoat requests.
