== HTTP Proxy Setup

Since this is an OWASP project, we'll be using ZAP. If you are comfortable using another proxy (e.g. Burp), you can skip this. Otherwise,
this will show you how to set up ZAP to act as a proxy on your localhost.

=== Setting up ZAP >= 2.8.0

If you use the latest ZAP version (>= 2.8.0) you only need to start ZAP and click the browser button to be able to
proxy, see image below:

To setup a different browser continue to the next page and read how to set it up in section: 'Configure the browser'.
In all other cases you can skip the next page and continue to the page titled 'Confirm it's working' to check whether it is working.
